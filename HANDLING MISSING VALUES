1. MISSING COMPLETELY AT RANDOM(MCAR)-THERE IS NO SUCH REASON WHY DATA IS MISSING AND THE MISSING DATA IS DISTRIBUTED RANDOMLY THROUGHOUT
2.MISSING AT RANDOM(MAR)-WHEN MISSING VALUES ARE DEPENDENT ON A SPECIFIC DATA LIKE(IN A SURVEY FORM MEN ARE NOT COMFORTABLE IN DISCLOSING THEIR SALARY OR INCOME AND WOMEN ARE NOT LIKELY TO DISCLOSE THEIR AGE)
3.MISSING DATA NOT AT RANDOM(MNAR)-EXAMPLE(IN A SURVEY OF JOB SATISFACTION AND INCOME PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THEIR JOB WILL NOT TELL THIE INCOME)


import seaborn as sns
df=sns.load_dataset('titanic')
df.head()

#check missing values
df.isnull()        // whereever missing values it will turn true and others will be false now
df.isnull().sum()  //tells number of missing values by sum
df.dropna(axis=1,inplace=true) // by doing this axis=1 we are droping columns now with null value not row and inplace keeps it permanent deleted or dropped

IMPUTATION TECHNIQUES
sns.displot(df['age'])

df['age_mean']=df['age'].fillna(df['age'].mean()) // filling null values with mean
df[['age_mean','age']]

## MEAN IMPUTATION WORKS WELL WHEN WE HAVE NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED DATA

// MEDIAN VALUE IMPUTATION - IF WE HAVE OUTLIERS IN A DATSET
df['age_median']=df['age'].fillna(df['age'].median()) 

//mode imputation techniques (for categorial data)
df[df['embarked'].isnull()]
