suppose we have a dataset with 100 yes and 900 no answeres that is the ratio of 9:1 which is imbalanced and biased so to handle this we have two techniques 
1.up sampling - increase number of datapoints in minority
2.down sampling - decrease number of datapoints in majority


SMOTE(SYNTHETIC MINORITY OVERSAMPLING TECHNIQUE)
IN DOWN OR UP SAMPLING IT CREATES NEW DATA POINTS OVER THE EXISTING DATA POINTS SO THE VARIANCE(WIDTH) REMAINS THE SAME BUT USING SMOTE IT CREATES A SYNTHETIC DATASET WHICH INCREASES THE WIDTH BY GIVING NEW DATA POINTS BETWEEN NEAREST EXISTING POINTS)
