                               ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE OR ANOVA TEST

->USE TO COMPARE THE MEANS OF 2 OR MORE GROUPS

->There are two important components in ANOVA that you will encounter frequently:

1.Factors
2.Levels

Factors
A factor is a variable that categorizes the data. For example, consider a medicine as a factor. This factor can have different categories or levels based on dosage.

Levels
Levels are the different categories within a factor. For instance, if the medicine factor has dosages of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, these dosages represent the levels of the medicine factor.

To summarize:

Factor: Medicine
Levels: 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg dosages

the four key assumptions in ANOVA are:

Normality: The sampling distribution of the mean is normally distributed.
Absence of Outliers: Outlying scores must be removed from the dataset.
Homogeneity of Variance: Population variances across different levels of each independent variable are equal.
Independence and Randomness: Samples are independent and randomly selected.
