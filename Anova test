                               ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE OR ANOVA TEST

->USE TO COMPARE THE MEANS OF 2 OR MORE GROUPS

->There are two important components in ANOVA that you will encounter frequently:

1.Factors
2.Levels

Factors
A factor is a variable that categorizes the data. For example, consider a medicine as a factor. This factor can have different categories or levels based on dosage.

Levels
Levels are the different categories within a factor. For instance, if the medicine factor has dosages of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, these dosages represent the levels of the medicine factor.

To summarize:

Factor: Medicine
Levels: 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg dosages

the four key assumptions in ANOVA are:

Normality: The sampling distribution of the mean is normally distributed.
Absence of Outliers: Outlying scores must be removed from the dataset.
Homogeneity of Variance: Population variances across different levels of each independent variable are equal.
Independence and Randomness: Samples are independent and randomly selected.


3 types of annova 
1. one way annova - one factor with atleast two levels ,these levels are independent.(example-tryind medication(factor) with different amt of doses(12mg,10mg...)(levels)
2.Repeated measures annova - one factor with atleast two levels ,these levels are dependent.(example-running(factor) day 1 day 2 day 3(levels) performance vary so dependent)
3.Factorial annova - two or more factors each of which with atleast two levels levels can be independent or dependent.(running(factor 1) based on gender(factor 2) male female(2 levels)days(levels)
